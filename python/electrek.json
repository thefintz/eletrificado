The new video shows Kia’s new PBV could be a potential Volkswagen ID.Buzz rival.\n\nWe got our first look at \n\n at the 2024 CES in January. Kia claimed its PBVs are designed as “a total mobility solution” that blends fit-for-purpose EVs with advanced software.\n\n“Kia’s PBV business represents our vision of going beyond the traditional concept of automobiles,” CEO Ho Sung Song explained.\n\nIts new purpose-built electric vans, with custom interiors and modern tech, “open the door to new businesses and lifestyles.”\n\nPromoted as “the answer to all your mobility needs,” Kia PBVs can be used to start a business, carry cargo, or provide delivery services.\n\nKia plans to cover all segments with three models (PV1, PV5, and PV7). The first to launch will be the PV5, Kia’s mid-size electric people mover.\n\nKia’s PV5 will be available in different configurations, including basic (for passengers), van (for delivery/ transport), or chassis cab (like a pickup truck bed). In the future, Kia also plans to launch an autonomous PV5-R designed for ride-hailing.\n\nAfter we \n\n in July, a new video from \n\n gives us a closer look at Kia’s first dedicated electric van.\n\nA PV5 prototype was spotted charging with a big boxy design. Despite the camouflage, you can see some design elements peeking through.\n\nKia’s first PBV maintains much of the design shown in the concept in January. The electric van features a modern, almost futuristic-like design built for the electric era.\n\nAll PBV models will be built on Kia’s dedicated e-CCPM (Electric Complete Chassis Platform Module) from Hyundai Mobis.\n\nKia will build PBV models at its new dedicated plant in Autoland Hwaseong, Korea. The factory is expected to open next year and have an annual capacity of up to 150,000. By 2030, Kia aims for output to reach 300,000.\n\nKia’s PBV business will challenge rivals like Volkswagen with the ID.Buzz. Ford, GM, Rivian, and others are also advancing purpose-built electric vans.\n\nIt took VW 7 years from concept to US version on the ID Buzz.\n\nThen they thought $62,000 and 230 mile range would be a hit.  Wrong.\n\nTrust KIA can deliver a van that is useable and has a second row of seats that are removable.\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.Buzz costs around $70,000 (€64,581) in Germany, including VAT. In the US, it starts at $61,545.\n\nAlthough Kia has not revealed official prices, the PV5 is expected to start at around $35,000. Kia showcased the PV5 and PV7 this week during the \n\n of its new PBV business.\n\nKia plans to introduce the production version next summer. At IAA Hannover, Kia announced every PBV will be covered by a seven-year/ 150,000 km warranty.\n\nKia has already secured its first PBV customer, Uber. The \n\n aims to offer ride-hailing PBVs on Uber’s platform.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/17/kias-first-electric-pbv-spotted-volkswagen-id-buzz-rival-video/"},

{"title": "Lotus’ wild 200mph ‘Theory 1’ EV signals return to form for the brand", "author": "Jameson Dow", "text": "Lotus has unveiled a new EV concept which it calls “Theory 1,” a lightweight(-ish) electric sportscar concept inspired by the Lotus Esprit with nearly 1,000hp and capable of speeds up to 200mph.\n\nHere at \n\n, we see and report on a \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n. These concepts are often accompanied by long treatises on how the design incorporates various “core principles,” unnecessary branding of things that will never make it to production, and \n\n.\n\nIn a way, the Theory 1 is no different. My eyes glazed over at the 2,000+ words in Lotus’ \n\n before reaching the table of technical specs.\n\nAnd yet, there is still something here, because this is Lotus – a company with an incredibly significant motorsport heritage… and a significant electric car heritage too.\n\nLotus is the company that provided the lightweight “gliders” on which the original Tesla Roadster, the car that started the modern electric vehicle era, was built.\n\nAnd lately, Lotus has gotten into electric cars on its own, with the \n\n and the consumer-focused \n\n and \n\n.\n\nBut you’ll notice – one of those things is not like the others. Despite being a company famous for its focus on small cars, owing to founder Colin Chapman’s theory to “simplify, then add lightness,” the Eletre and Emeya are both over 5,500lbs, more than twice the weight of the original Tesla Roadster.\n\nAnd so, Lotus’ new Theory 1 – packed full of probably-unrealistic concept features, but also clearly going downmarket from the Evija’s eyewatering $2million pricetag – could signal somewhat of a return to form for the wayward small-car maker.\n\nThat’s because its curb weight is listed at a much more reasonable 1600kg, or 3,527lbs. This is still hefty compared to the absolute lightest vehicles on the road right now, but it’s on the lower end of most powerful sportscars available today (including lighter than the Evija), quite low compared to other EVs, and significantly less than some \n\n.\n\nIt’s also a lot more than the original Lotus Esprit which the Theory 1 takes inspiration from, which began at around 2,000lbs. But later versions of the same vehicle weighed as much as around 3,000lbs, not too far off from the Theory 1.\n\nIn that relatively small package, Lotus claims it has fit some great performance specs.\n\nIts 986hp powertrain is capable of sprinting 0-100km/h (62mph) in less than 2.5 seconds, with a top speed of 320km/h (198mph).\n\nEnergy comes from a 70kWh battery with a 250 mile range. This is a little smaller than some of the larger batteries we’ve seen around (the Eletre has a 112kWh battery, for example), but that’s the benefit of having a light, low-slung vehicle.\n\nBut specs don’t tell everything about how a vehicle feels to drive. And Lotus is promising to bring exceptional driving dynamics to this vehicle, through methods like including the motor and battery as stressed members and mounting the rear wing directly to the suspension assembly.\n\nIt also wants to use steer-by-wire, a technology which has been thought about for a long time but only recently has made its way into production vehicles, like the Lexus RZ and Cybertruck.\n\nBut perhaps the most striking part of the driver experience on the Theory 1 is its 3-seat design, seating the driver in the center of the vehicle, similar to the famed McLaren F1.\n\nThe car’s light weight comes from extensive use of advanced materials like carbon fiber and titanium, which are sure to boost the price of this vehicle if they make it to production. In that previously-mentioned 2,000 words, there’s plenty of talk about 3D printing and recycled materials as well.\n\nBut Lotus says that it wants to reduce the amount of “A-surface materials” – those you can touch – down to 10 or fewer, compared to the 100-or-so in most cars.\n\n“There’s been this period of maximalism, and people having to do one-upmanship and go above, above, above. And I think we’ve reached that point where it plateaus in stylistic terms, and also in the demonstration of tech. We’re not in a crazy numbers race with this car.”\n\n -Lotus design VP Ben Payne, as \n\nSo the original Lotus philosophy of “simplify, then add lightness” is certainly present in this concept, signaling a return to form for the brand after a few years of wandering in the desert.\n\nWell I'll say this... It looks built electric. And that has always mattered to me when it comes to EV design. A lot. You can see it. Not so much the body. That's just aerodynamics with flair. Great as it may be. I'm talking about the proportions. Plus I'm a fan of lean design. Not minimalist... Fit. A minimalist design, though nice looking, can still be poorly executed. Not the case here. So even the interior speaks to me. Fit AF.\n\nI think it does them proud.\n\nFinally, while we are just talking about a concept here, we’ve certainly seen plenty of EV concepts \n\n in some way or another. Even particularly wild ones like the \n\n ended up being made into the \n\n sportscar.\n\nSo we might even see this Theory 1 show up on the road at some point. But, even if we don’t, at least it shows that Lotus is back to thinking about \n\n (as they should have been all along…), and we’ll hopefully get a real EV sportscar out of them in a few years.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/17/lotus-wild-200mph-theory-1-ev-signals-return-to-form-for-the-brand/"},

GM Energy vice president, Wade Sheffer, spoke:\n\nGM’s ongoing efforts to help accelerate the expansion of public charging infrastructure is an integral part of our commitment to an all-electric future. Enabling access to even more publicly available fast chargers represents yet another way GM is focused on further improving the customer experience and making the transition to electric more seamless.\n\nPer GM, EV drivers of its portfolio of marques will be able to purchase the Tesla adapter through their respective apps for $225. They can then use that same app to locate the nearest available Tesla Superchargers, check station status, initiate a charge and pay for their session.\n\nGM states that each Tesla adapter has been developed to ensure customers can charge their EV at any charger that offers the North American Charging Standard. The American automaker is leveraging several suppliers to produce them to ensure everyone who wants one can get one.\n\nThe automaker states that the adapters will begin rolling out in the US immediately, followed by Canada later this year.

(via \n\n):\n\nI would recommend AGAINST using an extension cord on a supercharger (or any DC charging station with a liquid cooled cable). Have seen multiple instances of the cable overheated and shorting DC +/-.\n\nTo be fair, he is recommending against using existing extension cables for the Supercharger, which are made by third parties.\n\nHe added about the problem with extension cables:\n\nThere’s a temperature measurement in the handle and the supercharger derates based on that temperature. With the extension cable that safety goes away. On top of adding an additional junction which generates heat making matters worse.\n\nDon't want people to use extension cords? Swap more v3 stations to v4 and add more pull through charging.\n\nTesla could possibly fix those things with its own solution, especially by adding temperature measurements on the new handle on the extension cord.\n\nMorrill said that he would discuss directly with a third-party Supercharger extension cable manufacturer to explain his concerns.\n\nHowever, temperature management would remain an issue as it is hard to imagine how they could make the extension liquid-cooled like the regular cable. \n\nSome did speculate that a Tesla extension cord would come with charge rate limitations to counter this issue.

Today’s deal comes in as a 22% markdown that lands it at the second-lowest price we can find, giving you a chance to shave $350 off this higher-end e-scooter.\n\nComing in four colorways, \n\n arrives “inheriting the DNA of the world’s fastest production car” and sporting a sleek, aerodynamic design with a lightweight, magnesium alloy frame. It cruises into view with a 500W motor that peaks at 1,000W to provide faster acceleration times, tackle inclines up to 18%, and challenge any rougher terrain – with extra support from the hidden suspension and 10-inch self-healing tires. The scooter’s 36V 15.6Ah battery ensures a travel range of up to 37 miles on a single charge, with three riding modes (eco, city, sport) to set different speed limits and prolong/shorten travel distance depending on your chosen setting.\n\nThe 10 Max e-scooter has also been given lighting all around its frame for added safety while riding at darker hours, with front headlights, dual turn signal lights, base lights around its sides, and a rear brake light – plus, in true Bugatti fashion, the back-end also projects an “EB” monogram logo onto the ground behind you. There’s also a beautifully integrated touchscreen display to adjust settings, activate its cruise control functions, and lock/unlock the scooter via a passcode for added security.\n\nCollected together in its \n\n, Best Buy is offering a huge one-day deal on the \n\n for the rest of the day. Regularly fetching $6,000 at the moment after falling from its $6,500 MSRP a few months ago, this model has seen very few discounts since first releasing a year ago, first to $6,000 during its first month on the market and again during Christmas sales. We’ve also seen two previous one-day sales from earlier in 2024 that only ever brought costs down to $5,500 at most. Well today, folks are getting the best deal we’ve seen yet at a massive $2,000 markdown that lands it at a new all-time low price.\n\nThe \n\n jets out of the gates with a massive 4,000W rear-drive motor that peaks at 8,000W of terrain-conquering power and tops out at speeds of 53 MPH. The 72V removable battery gives this model 50 miles of traveling range, which can be fully recharged in about four hours. It’s been given plenty of additional features for an even more enhanced motocross experience, like multiple riding modes, hydraulic disc brakes, dual-shock suspension, and deep-tooth off-road tires. There’s also the dual headlights, a taillight that provides braking and turn signal functionality, mudguards, and an LED digital display. It’s also surprisingly lightweight for a dirt bike – even an electric model – with everything totaling up to 172 pounds.\n\nComing to us through its official Amazon storefront, Jackery is offering its \n\n, \n\n. Normally priced at $149, we’ve seen two different rates dropping across 2024, with most of them dropping to $100 and one short-term instance of it falling further to $90 during July’s Prime Day event. Today though, Prime Day is taking a back seat as costs get taken $1 lower with this combined $60 markdown that etches out a new all-time low price.\n\nJackery’s \n\n is a great alternative for folks in need of far more juice for their personal devices than most of the pocketable power banks can provide, delivering a 99Wh LiFePo4 capacity (31,000mAh) and a 128W power output. Its more compact size can easily be stashed away inside your bag to carry with you throughout your everyday life on top of covering you for fun trips camping and the like. There’s dual USB-C ports and a single USB-A port here for your device’s charging needs, with the unit itself only taking an hour to fill 70% of its battery when connected to a standard wall outlet (under two hours for 100%). If you plug in a 100W solar panel, you can expect a full battery via solar charging in about two hours – or, you can plug it into your car’s auxiliary port for a full charge in up to three hours.\n\nThere’s a couple bonus offers here to consider too, with the first being a bundle that gives you the \n\n, \n\n You can also receive a \n\n when purchasing \n\n.\n\nWe’ve just spotted amazing one-day back-to-back deals for folks in need of a powerful solution to clean up their driveways, walkways, and more. Available as part of its \n\n, Best Buy is offering the popular \n\n. Normally priced at $450, this standalone model has seen far more discounts over at Amazon than it has at Best Buy, where its fully-detailed combo kit is more frequently featured. It’s mainly been keeping around $360 throughout 2024, with some discounts taking things further to the former $300 low in July and $310 just two weeks ago. Today though, we’re seeing those prices beaten out in strides by this $160 markdown that drops things lower than ever to a new all-time low – \n\n too. Head below to learn more about this model, as well as the bundle option to increase its cleaning power with extra savings.\n\nThis \n\n systems come housed within a heavy-duty frame, sporting a 14A TruBrushless motor to max out at an impressive 3,000 PSI with a 1.1 to 2.0 GPM flow rate too. If the higher pressure rating wasn’t enough, there’s also an onboard one-gallon detergent tank and a bunch of included accessories too – with five versatile nozzles that can be stored inside the provided space alongside the 25 feet of non-marring hose. To help save you money while ensuring a longer lifespan for its motor, it’s been given Greenworks’ Total Stop System that shuts off the pump the moment the trigger is disengaged.\n\nThe second of these Deals of the Day is the \n\n that starts at \n\n down from $80 – plus, if you bundle it here today with the above pressure washer, you’ll save even more as the price drops down to \n\n. It has an easy quick-connect feature for a faster and more effortless setup, with dual cleaning nozzles on its underside to level up the pressure washer’s cleaning power and coverage area. You can also buy this attachment separately for any Greenworks pressure washer that is rated for up to 3,100 PSI.\n\nAmazon is now offering an electrified fun time in the form of \n\n. Normally fetching $900, with an even higher $950 price tag coming directly from Razor, this model has seen a rare handful of discounts over the year so far, first hitting $689 in 2024 back at the start of the year and slowly climbing higher in price since. From March through July, we’ve only seen it riding along at $831, with August bringing steady increases up to $900. Today, we’re getting a much-needed break from these higher rates with a 23% markdown that cuts $211 off the tag and returns costs back to the lowest price we have tracked in 2024.\n\nThis \n\n is more tailored for fun rather than getting you out and about town for your appointments, though if you’re only going a short distance, it can still get the job done in that regard. The miniaturized supersport motorcycle-inspired frame houses a 650W chain-driven motor and a 36V battery that work together to offer up to an hour of runtime before it needs a recharge. You or your kids will be able to cruise around at an impressive 17 MPH, with added features for your comfort (It is a micro model afterall). There’s 14-inch street tires, a rear suspension, a variable speed twist-grip throttle, and rear disc brakes to ensure a fun joyride for all who jump aboard, and even includes a surprise hidden storage compartment too.\n\nThe savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/17/exclusive-bugatti-10-max-e-scooter-350-off-gotrax-everest-dirt-bike-2000-off-jackery-explorer-100-plus-89-more/"},
{"title": "Gazelle launches three new lower-cost Bosch mid-drive e-bikes in US", "author": "Micah Toll", "text": "Bosch-powered electric bikes rarely get to share the same sentence as the word “low cost,” but Gazelle has a history of bringing quality Dutch-made mid-drive e-bikes to US customers at reasonable prices. The brands’ latest launches in the US keep that legacy alive, delivering new 2024 versions of the \n\n.\n\nThese aren’t the same Gazelles we’ve seen in the US for the last few years, but rather newly designed updates that feature novel frames, updated looks, and a focus on serving a wider range of riders.\n\nOne major difference in the frame is the inclusion of a true step-through design, which is becoming more common among e-bike makers with several recently released models of purely step-through bikes, eschewing the once common strategy of building both step-over and step-through frames.\n\nProper frame geometries and welding techniques, which you’d better believe a 130-year-old Dutch bicycle company has mastered, have largely made that top tube obsolete for many frame styles. Case in point: the new Gazelle Medio T9 and Medio T9 City models.\n\n“A re-engineered frame with improved stiffness and stability makes it easier to step on and off, especially in urban environments or for older riders,” explained the company.\n\nThe new T9s are some of the most affordable Bosch-powered mid-drive e-bikes available in the US, starting at US $2,299 for the T9 City and US $2,599 for the all-road T9.\n\nBoth models sport similar step-thru frames that come in four sizes, including a new XS size to fit shorter riders of 4’9″ to 5’2″ (145 to 157 cm). Both models can also reach 20 mph (32 km/h) on pedal assist, making them Class 1 e-bikes. The pair of bikes include 75mm-travel spring suspension forks from Suntour, dual-piston hydraulic disc brakes from Shimano, and come with commuter-focused standard components such as fenders, rear rack, LED lighting, and frame locks that secure the rear wheel to the bike.\n\nThe T9, which is designed for more all-road conditions than the urban-centric T9 City, gets an upgraded Shimano Alivio 9-speed drivetrain and a more powerful Bosch Active Line Plus motor with 50 Nm of torque, compared to the Bosch Active Line’s 40 Nm of torque on the T9 City. The more powerful motor is paired with a larger 545 Wh battery, upping the 400 Wh battery that comes with the T9 City.\n\n, the switch to an on-tube battery helps lower the center of gravity of the bikes.\n\nFor riders who want to go a bit more premium, the new Gazelle Ultimate C8 might be the better choice. The Ultimate C8 combines its step-thru frame with a Gates Carbon Drive belt-drive system and a Shimano Nexus 8 internally geared rear hub.\n\nThe bike features a mono-integrated suspension stem in the fork offering 40mm of travel, higher-end LED lighting, an MIK-compatible rear rack for mounting a wide range of accessories, \n\nThe drivetrain on the Class 1 Ultimate C8 consists of a Bosch Active Line Plus motor and a 500Wh Bosch battery.\n\nPriced at US $3,999, the Ultimate C8’s higher end components and drivetrain price it a bit higher, yet without reaching the upper end of Gazelle’s more European-leaning flagship models with flagship prices.\n\n“We’re thrilled to bring high-quality ebikes to the North American market at a price that makes them accessible to more riders,” said Mark Danhof, General Manager for Gazelle North America. “With our latest models, consumers don’t have to compromise on safety, reliability, or features. Our ebikes are designed to offer top-notch performance and convenience, ensuring every ride is enjoyable and worry-free.”\n\nGazelle’s expansion into the US market and the updated designs that accompany it are great news for riders who want the more robust, premium European-style electric bikes common across the pond but don’t want to spend an entire paycheck or two to get there. \n\nThese updates help bring Gazelle’s best-selling e-bikes in the US to a more modern look (no one will miss the rack batteries!) while retaining what keeps them Dutch. Oh, and the new smaller frame size option is going to be quite welcome, as well. \n\na couple of years ago and spent much of the time with a stiff neck from looking up at the friendly Gazelle staff towering above me. Let’s just say they’re built differently, and so a smaller frame size for shorter Americans couldn’t come soon enough.\n\nWhile these aren’t going to be the flashiest models out there, they offer great production quality and the peace of mind that comes from having one of the oldest bicycle companies in existence standing behind these products.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/18/gazelle-launches-three-new-lower-cost-bosch-mid-drive-e-bikes-in-us/"},

The bigger-picture aim is to share learnings with other shippers and carriers so that they, in turn, also transition to electrification at scale. The shipper-carrier coalition also wants to encourage technology providers to accelerate the development of turn-key solutions for electric transport.\n\nThe launch of this coalition aligns with the federal government’s National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which lays out a framework for electric truck adoption and charging infrastructure deployment.\n\nChristoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, said, “Through this coalition, we seek to jointly accelerate the uptake of long-haul EV heavy-duty trucks. Together with Terawatt and other coalition partners, we look forward to accelerating freight decarbonization and proving that the electric truck corridor can promptly become operational at low volumes and rapidly scale up afterward.”\n\n \n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/17/maersk-pepsico-heavy-duty-ev-charging-corridor/"},

The company sold a record over 373,000 new energy vehicles (including PHEVs) in August. Of them, 148,470 were all-electric.\n\nBYD’s Seagull was the top-selling vehicle in China in August, with 40,949 models sold. The company said the Seagull is now China’s best-selling A00 class model and pure electric car for the sixth consecutive month.\n\nThe Seagull EV is available in three trims in China with two \n\n options (30.08 kWh or 38.88 kWh), providing up to 252 miles (405 km) CLTC range.\n\nBYD’s low-cost EV has earned the nickname “mini Lamborghini” as former Lamborghini designer Wolfgang Egger led the Seagull’s design.\n\nInside, the Seagull is loaded with BYD’s latest tech and software, including a 10.1″ rotating infotainment with DiLink intelligent network connection.\n\nBYD is selling the Seagull EV overseas as the Dolphin Mini. In Brazil, the Dolphin Mini (Seagull) starts at around $20,000 (99,800 BRL). It’s roughly the same in Mexico at 358,800 pesos, or around $19,000.\n\nBYD’s cheapest EV is \n\n in and outside of China. Even Ford’s CEO Jim Farley called the Seagull a “pretty damn good” car, warning rivals of BYD’s low-cost EV. In comparison, Ford only sold 8,944 EVs combined last month.\n\nThe Seagull is expected to launch as one of the most affordable EVs in Europe, starting at under 20,000 euros ($21,500).\n\nAlthough several automakers have promised to launch lower-priced EVs, will they be able to keep up with BYD? And, more importantly, still earn a profit?\n\nBYD has control over almost every part of the manufacturing process for their vehicles. Legacy auto has no chance against this advantage. China has been gearing up for the EV world adoption for over a decade now. If BYD can sell it's cars at 100% markup and still be lower priced than the others, how are they going to compete with that?\n\nAccording to AutoForecast Solutions CEO Joe McCabe, BYD’s Seagull would still be \n\n at under $25,000, even with a 100% tariff.\n\nNorth American CEO Stella Li has already said BYD has no plans to launch passenger EVs (they already sell electric buses) in the US.

Sources familiar with the matter said it could happen as early as next year.\n\nThe site makes VW Passat and Skoda vehicles with up to 360,000 annual production capacity. SAIC Volkswagen has already halted production at one plant, and a second is slowing production, with a possible closure in sight.\n\nLast year, production across VW’s (39) plants in China was still a quarter below its peak before the pandemic.\n\nAs domestic automakers gain market share with low-cost EVs, gas-powered vehicles, especially from foreign brands, are quickly falling out of favor.\n\nVolkswagen’s Skoda brand is among those whose sales are sinking in China. Sources said production at a plant in Ningbo that builds Skoda models has been halted for several months at a time and could also face closure.\n\nVW China responded to \n\n, saying, “All SAIC Volkswagen factories are operating normally according to the market requirements and our forecast.”\n\nThe emailed statement added, “We are also transforming vehicle production and the components plants step by step” for smart electric vehicles.\n\nAccording to the sources, the plant could be due for an overhaul.

{"title": "Range Energy’s electric trailer helps CA egg farm improve mpg by ‘up to 70%’", "author": "Jameson Dow", "text": "Range Energy’s electric trailer, which allows fleets to effectively hybridize by adding a battery and motor to the trailer, has been put into service by Petaluma Egg Farm to improve efficiency of its diesel shipping fleet by 50-70%.\n\nThe concept behind Range Energy’s trailer is relatively simple. Instead of the diesel-engine tractor having to do all the work to pull the trailer, Range adds a battery and motor to the trailer to help it push its own weight forward, effectively cutting the amount of weight the diesel engine has to pull and therefore increasing efficiency.\n\nIt sounds like a bit of a hack, but the purpose behind it is that electric tractors are quite expensive and are still ramping up in production. Meanwhile, trucking companies already have working diesel tractors that could be expected to have many years of life left, and aren’t necessarily excited to scrap their expensive tractors for an expensive new electric one.\n\nWhile the swap works out for many companies, especially if it fits into the fleet buying timeline and a company is ready to replace its diesel trucks, there are other fleets that might benefit from an easier, more short-term drop-in solution.\n\nAnd that’s what Range Energy’s trailer provides, because it doesn’t require any sort of retrofitting of the diesel engine, it’s just a pick-up-and-go solution.\n\nIt works with what Range calls the “smart kingpin,” which is packed with sensors to tell the trailer how hard the tractor is pulling. It then adds its own torque proportional to the amount the tractor is asking for, making loads feel lighter.\n\nWe got a chance to see a \n\n, and let me say, it was one of the coolest demos I’ve experienced.\n\nSince then, Range has had its trailer validated through independent testing, which said it can \n\n in average use cases. Given that fuel costs are a large part of any trucking company’s outlays, and that diesel fuel burned in heavy duty vehicles creates an outsized portion of smog-forming pollutants, this is a quick way to get some real improvements.\n\nThe trailer can also be used on electric trucks as an impromptu “range extender,” essentially just adding a larger battery carried by the trailer, in addition to whatever amount of energy storage the tractor has onboard.\n\nThere are some other companies with a similar solution, including a company called \n\n. But the US and European markets are different, so there’s room for both in this realm.\n\nThe news today is that Range Energy’s trailer has been put into service in a real-world test, including taking advantage of its large battery for refrigeration. Refrigerated or “reefer” trucks are used widely throughout the industry, but this is the first order Range has gotten for its electrified reefer solution.\n\nThe company in question is Petaluma Egg Farm, a family-owned business that serves Northern California grocery stores. It ordered and will deploy 10 of Range’s trailers over the next 12-18 months.\n\nThe order follows a successful pilot by the farm which it ran in July, testing the trailer on routes between 100 and 440 miles, and also on city distribution routes consisting of more than 15 delivery stops.\n\nDuring the trial, the trailer had 100% uptime, and did not need any additional time for charging beyond typical downtime. Range says it delivered “up to 70%” mpg improvements. We followed up on that (since it sure seems like “up to” is doing a lot of heavy lifting there), and were told that “average” improvements tallied between 50-70% – but this is highly dependent on a number of factors, so take it with a grain of salt, especially given that the third-party test above showed 36% improvements on a standardized route.\n\nNevertheless, it shows that in this real-world circumstance, the trailer has worked well to reduce fuel costs for the company in question. And on routes that are perhaps easier-than-average, improvements better than 36% are possibly.\n\nWe’ve been quite interested in Range Energy ever since demoing their system at ACT Expo and talking to their leadership.\n\nWhile the system isn’t fully electric – the Range trailer is electric, but is still driven by a diesel tractor – it’s still a great way to drop in to a fleet and get an improvement right away.\n\nWe’d rather have everyone go all electric, which they will in the longer term. But in the short and medium term, this will still reduce pollution quickly.\n\nThe one thing we’re worried about is what Range will do once every truck already is electric. There’s still some use for these trailers in those circumstances, as they might fit into an ecosystem where tractors can be sold with a relatively smaller amount of energy storage for shorter routes that don’t need much energy, and then Range trailers can be added to those tractors for longer routes.\n\nBut this does feel like a more niche application. However, Range’s leadership seems to have good heads on their shoulders, and they’re a quickly moving company, so we think they’ll be able to figure something out.\n\nRegardless, in the short term, this is quite a boon and we’d love to see more of these out there in the wild. Good on Petaluma Egg Farm for taking the initiative here.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/18/range-energys-electric-trailer-helps-egg-farm-improve-mpg-by-up-to-70/"},

The longer-range (88.1 kWh battery) model is rated with up to 447 miles (720 km) driving range.\n\nKia \n\n in China last November, starting at just $21,000 (149,800 yuan). The price undercuts the Model Y, which starts at around $35,000 (249,900 yuan).\n\nAccording to Kia’s Chinese joint venture partner, Jiangsu Yueda Kia, the EV5 is already making an impact.\n\nThe company announced it sold 22,498 vehicles in August, up 36% from last year. August was Kia’s best month so far in 2024 and its third straight month of topping 20,000 in brand sales.\n\n“By sustaining monthly sales of over 20,000 units, Kia has shown it’s on the right path in China,” Kim Sung-rae, a Hanwha Investment & Securities market analyst said.\n\nKia’s sales in China, including exports, reached 154,243 through the first eight months of 2024, a 61% jump from last year.\n\nAccording to \n\n, Kia is now a top-selling brand among joint venture automakers in China.\n\nKia expects to sell over 230,000 vehicles by the end of 2024 at its current pace. If Kia hits its mark, it would be the first time it has crossed the 200,000 sales mark since 2020.\n\nThe EV5 has been a key factor as Kia revamps sales in China. Kia sold nearly 6,000 EV5 models in China through July.\n\nKia exports in China are also surging. As of August, its Yancheng plant exported over 300,000 vehicles, the highest among joint venture partners in China.\n\nWhile many foreign automakers have struggled to keep pace in China’s fast-moving EV market, Kia is taking advantage.\n\nEarlier today, \n\n reported (based on a \n\n report) that Volkswagen’s Chinese joint venture with SAIC is \n\n due to overcapacity.\n\nKia’s new low-cost EV5 is helping the brand compete with domestic automakers like BYD, which dominate the market. BYD’s Seagull EV, which starts at under $10,000 (69,800 yuan), was China’s \n\n, with nearly 41,000 models sold\n\nI don’t understand why they don’t offer the EV5 in the US.  Seems like it would be the perfect size for the US market. \n\nKia is launching the EV5 in new markets like Australia and New Zealand later this year, likely boosting sales further.\n\nChina is not the only market in which Kia’s sales are surging. Last month, Kia sold more vehicles in the US than it ever has. With over 75,200 cars sold in August, Kia \n\n for the third consecutive month.\n\nKia’s first three-row electric SUV, the EV9, is helping drive growth in the US. Through August, Kia has sold nearly 13,900 EV9 models in the US this year.\n\nWith a series of low-cost EVs, including the EV3 and EV4, rolling out globally, Kia will be a brand to watch over the next few quarters as it takes on market leaders.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/18/kia-ev5-shows-promise-china-brand-sales-top-20000-again/"},

Also, check out the new \n\n.\n\nCoinciding with the pre-order launch special being offered by Xtracycle on its \n\n, which we were quite excited by in our\n\n (with a review coming soon), the brand is offering a bundled discount on its \n\n that drops costs to \n\n. Normally this higher-end e-bike would run you $4,499 on most days, with far less frequent discounts across the brand’s entire lineup than its competitors. You’re looking at a $500 markdown on its usual going rate, but what makes this deal all the better is the inclusion of a free Everyday Rider Bundle that you’ll get free of charge. The bundle includes an everyday bike pack, a 40L cargo bag that goes right onto the bike, a magic carpet padded cushion for passengers, and a Hooptie rail system for when those passengers may be on the younger sides of life – all valued at $590 for a total of $1,090 in savings.\n\nXtracycle’s \n\n cruises streets, trails, and more – all while hauling your most precious cargo along with you, whether that be packages, groceries, or even children. The chromoly steel frame houses a 630Wh battery that juices the Shimano STEPS EP-8 motor to reach up to 20 MPH with its pedal assistance support (but there are no throttles here). This model boasts a 400-pound payload overall, with it able to carry the weight 30 to 60 miles on a single charge, depending on conditions.\n\nXtracycle has given the Stoker e-bike a pair of 24-inch NICA’GNAR Cargo Tires to tackle terrain, with fenders over both and 4-piston hydraulic disc brakes for ensured stopping power. Its integrated cargo rack (which is only bolstered for added support with all the free goodies) comes along with other features like the Sram NX11 X-HORIZON derailleur, integrated LED headlights and taillights, and an E-series cycling computer that gives you easy handlebar access to controlling your settings as you ride.\n\nRunning alongside its ongoing \n\n, Anker’s official Amazon storefront is offering its \n\n, \n\n. This model is normally priced at $599, with discounts often dropping parallel to the C800 Plus model, most often down to $449, which has been ousted today with this 33% markdown that lands it at a new all-time low price. It also happens to \n\n.\n\nThe \n\n is a reliable camp support that you’ll be happy to have and not need over needing it and not having one. It delivers a reliable 768Wh LiFePO4 battery capacity, pumping out up to 1,600W of power at a time, and comes ready to recharge your devices and small appliances with its 10 output ports: a single car port, two USB-C, two USB-As, and five ACs. It features the usual array of smart controls you expect from an Anker station, accessed through the companion app so you can keep an eye on its levels or adjust settings as you prefer them. Recharging takes as little as 58 minutes when you plug it into a standard wall outlet, or you can connect up to 300W of solar input to take advantage of solar charging when the sun is out.\n\nIt’s \n\n sibling is also down at the lowest rate we’ve tracked for \n\n, \n\nThe difference here is that the extra $50 gets you two water-resistant LED camping lights with three different lighting modes to choose from – plus, they stow away right inside the top of the unit to be recharged while not in use. It also comes with a retractable pole arm that you can use as a hanger, tripod, or even a selfie stick.

Normally priced at $700, after falling from a higher $750 tag back at the top of 2024, we’ve been seeing a consistent slashing of prices throughout the year so far, with prices mainly keeping between $600 and $615, while occasionally falling further to $550, as well as the $500 low. Even during Prime Day sales we only saw it drop to $613, with today’s deal coming in with an even larger 29% markdown, saving you $200 and returning it back to its all-time lowest price that we have tracked.

It can even handle inclines up to 20% which may not seem like much, but it’s double a lot of other models under the brand’s flag.\n\nThere are three riding modes with this model – speed limit, standard, and sport – with mileage varying based on which of these settings you choose. Things are balanced more here with this model as the smart battery management system not only monitors battery functions for safety purposes but also utilizes regenerative braking to recycle energy and extend travel times. There’s dual braking and a foldable frame here, much like other Ninebot models, a built-in LED headlight, smart controls via the companion app, and an LED digital dashboard too.\n\nThrough its official Amazon storefront, Goal Zero is giving folks the best rate we’ve seen on its \n\n,\n\n. This model was listed at $5,000 at the start of 2024 (still is direct from Goal Zero), with the first few rounds of discounts through March bringing costs down to $2,999, which seems to have become its new going rate since. From April on, we’ve only seen occasional falls by $500 to the former $2,500 low, but today’s 17% markdown has come in to usurp the title as the lowest price we have tracked.\n\nWith so many friend groups and families gearing up to enjoy outdoor autumn experiences, Goal Zero has provided \n\n to run appliances and keep most everyday devices charged – even EVs you’ve brought along! You’ll get 6,071Wh of battery capacity with this unit, which also provides up to 2,000W of output power (peaking at 3,500W when needed) that can tackle emergency black-outs alongside trips away from home. There are plenty of versatile output port options as well: two 120V AC ports that support a combined load of 2,000W, a fast-charging 60W USB-C port, three USB-A ports, a regulated 12V port, and a bonus 12V car charger.\n\nThe Yeti 6000X’s battery can be fully recharged in 12 hours when plugged into a standard wall outlet, meaning you can plug it in the day before you’re departure and have plenty of time to spare. It can also refuel the battery with a maximum 600W solar input within 18 to 36 hours, depending on conditions – plus, there’s the full array of smart controls accessed through its companion app, letting you monitor and adjust settings.\n\nThrough its official Amazon storefront, GoTrax is offering its \n\n, \n\n. Normally this newer model would run you $600 lately, which it has largely remained at since releasing during the summer of last year. We saw its first discount in August 2023 bring costs down to this same amount, which was repeated three times in the first four months of 2024, before a later drop to $612 in mid-August. Today, costs are getting brought back down to the best rate that we’ve seen on Amazon since it first hit the market, saving you a solid $60 on this affordable commuting solution.\n\nThis \n\n provides plenty of support to get you where you need to be, without burning a hole through your finances like some higher-end solutions. It arrives with a 350W motor (peaking at 500W) and a removable 36V 7.8Ah battery that will have you zipping around at 15.5 MPH, perfect for leisurely rides around the neighborhood or your daily to commutes to work – plus, it features a folding design so where ever you end up, storage is far less of a hassle.\n\nThere are two riding modes here to choose from, aside from just riding it like any other bike – you can either go full electric with the throttle for up to 15.5 miles or you can be supported by the pedal assistance that extends that range up to 28 miles. It also comes stocked with dual-mechanical disc brakes, an LED headlight, 16-inch one-piece rims, a rear shock absorber, and simple controls on the handlebars to switch between settings.\n\nThe savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear.\n\n ", "url": "https://electrek.co/2024/09/18/xtracycle-stoker-e-bike-solix-c800-segway-max-g30lp-more/"},

Unlike Plug & Charge or Autocharge, Juice’s technology doesn’t require OEM integrations to work with different types of EVs.\n\nBrooklyn-based \n\n asserts that this is the first deployment of this kind of computer vision technology in the US. \n\nThe new Juice technology is now available on all Revel DC fast chargers and is compatible with all makes and models of EVs. Revel says it will integrate Juice’s computer vision technology at future sites opening later this year. \n\nRevel has 54 DC fast chargers open to the public across three sites in Brooklyn and Queens and plans to quadruple that network by mid-2025 with new locations, including a mega 60-stall station in Maspeth, Queens, and a 48-stall station outside LaGuardia Airport. Revel is opening its first downtown Manhattan charging station later this year on Pier 36. \n\nBecause Revel has a charging \n\n, rideshare drivers make up the majority of Revel’s public charging activity.\n\n“Revel is the perfect fit for our platform, with high usage at all of their charging locations, combined with the sheer size of their expanding network in America’s densest city,” said James Murfin, CEO & cofounder of Juice. “This partnership demonstrates how EV charging can be as seamless as unlocking your phone with your face. Only experiences that are truly this easy will help the world move to sustainable transport at scale.”\n\nThe company also has seven sites in development across the Bay Area and recently announced its first lease in downtown Los Angeles. \n\nYou pull up. The charger recognizes your EV the way your iPhone recognizes your face, and once you plug it in, it begins to charge. It takes payment. You unplug. You leave. It doesn’t matter which EV you drive. It just works for everyone.\n\nIf this actually works as it’s supposed to, this could change everything about the fast charging experience. Prior to Revel’s Juice launch, xCharge launched the first Juice-enabled public charger at their Austin headquarters in August.

It’s hard to imagine a bunch of truckers excited to drive an electric truck, but that’s exactly what PepsiCo claims.\n\nYesterday, we reported on \n\n.\n\nAt the same conference today, Priestley sat down with Dejan Antunović, PepsiCo’s head of electriciation for a “case study” of the brevage and snack company’s deployment of Tesla Semi trucks:\n\nFor a “case study”, they didn’t dive too deep into details, but they did push the message that the deployment is going great.\n\nAntunović insisted that the program is going “smoother than expected” and especially with the drivers who are giving positive feedback. The manager went as far as saying that the electric truck helps with driver retention.\n\nFirst off, Antunović explained what are the company’s trucking needs and how Tesla Semi electric trucks are used in that fleet.\n\nPepsiCo is using the Tesla Semi across three of its fleets:\n\nCurrently, PepsiCo’s Tesla Semi trucks are based at three depots in California: Modesto, Sacramento, and Fresno. The Modesto depot operates 15 Tesla Semis, all used for regional long-haul routes. In Sacramento, there are 21 Tesla Semis, with 18 assigned to local routes and 3 to regional long-haul routes. The Fresno depot manages 50 Tesla Semis, 45 of which run local routes, while 5 handle regional long-haul routes.\n\nThat’s 89 Tesla Semi trucks.\n\nPepsiCo is believed to be a good test partner for electric truck deployment due to their needs for both short and long haul as well as their lighter snack loads and heavier brevage loads.\n\nGiven how much nicer I've found driving an EV to be for the few hours a week I do: I'm not at all surprised that commerical drivers (who spend a whole workweek behind the wheel) don't want to go back to a conventional truck.\n\nQuieter, better torque and responsiveness, not smelly, etc. Sounds great to me.\n\nWithout going into the details about cost, PepsiCo appears to back Tesla’s claims that Tesla Semi can replace a diesel truck one-for-one in term of capacity and cost.\n\nThe purchase cost is expected to be much more expensive. However, Tesla says that its focus is on Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), which benefits EVs thanks to fuel savings.\n\nDuring the talk, Priestley said that efficiency has the biggest impact on Tesla Semi’s TCO as the more efficient Tesla makes the truck, the bigger the difference in fuel savings.\n\nYesterday, Tesla claimed that the electric truck is achieving \n\n, which is better than originally expected.

According to a VW statement, roughly 200 workers will be furloughed at the plant.\n\nThe first ID.4 \n\n at VW’s Chattanooga, TN, plant in July 2022. At the time, Volkswagen said it was looking to hire 1,000 new workers to ramp up production.\n\nA little over two years later, Volkswagen is temporarily suspending production with a recall potentially impacting around 100,000 ID.4 models nationwide.\n\nVolkswagen said in a statement that the temporary ID.4 production halt will result in about 200 workers at the Chattanooga plant being furloughed. The company plans to support the workers with supplemented state unemployment and 80% of their base compensation during the furlough, which starts on September 23.\n\nThe company explained, “While we address the issue, we are focused on doing right by our employees, dealers, and consumers through this disruption.”\n\nAccording to Volkswagen, the production halt could last until the beginning of next year as it works to resolve the issue. \n\nVolkswagen is working with dealers to find a quick fix. The recall, which was reported earlier this month, could potentially impact 98,806 ID.4 models in the US due to malfunctioning door handles.\n\nThe \n\n to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) stated the door handles could allow water to enter the circuit board assembly, which may lead to the doors opening unexpectedly.\n\nVW dealers will inspect the vehicle, replace the parts, and update the software if necessary. The service will be free of charge.\n\nOwner notification letters are expected to be mailed on November 1, 2024. If you have questions, you can contact VW’s customer service at 1-800-8930-5298. Volkswagen’s number for the recall is 57J9. Vehicles previously repaired (23V-312 and 23V-213) will still need the new remedy.\n\nVolkswagen said the disruption “In no way changes our commitment to the ID.4 and our growing BEV portfolio.”\n\nSo they are halting production for months and furloughing workers because of this door handle thing?! It doesn’t make much sense-are they really halting because they can’t sell the vehicles?\n\nThe company added that the ID.4 “remains one of America’s bestselling electric vehicles.” In the \n\n, Volkswagen sold 5,690 ID.4 models in the US, down 15% YOY.
