## Tesla’s Autonomy Promise Under Scrutiny

A Tesla has long promised a future of autonomous driving, a commitment that traces back to 2016. At that time, the company assured that all vehicles were equipped with hardware capable of full autonomy. However, recent developments raise questions about whether those claims hold true. 

### Elon Musk's Caution on Hardware 3

During the third-quarter financial call, CEO Elon Musk expressed uncertainty regarding the ability of existing Tesla vehicles, particularly those manufactured in early 2023, to achieve fully autonomous driving. This revelation has sent ripples of concern among Tesla owners equipped with Hardware 3.

Musk's comments indicate:
- **Lack of Certainty**: "The answer is that we're not 100% sure if HW3 will work with unsupervised FSD."
- **Enhanced Capabilities of Hardware 4**: "HW4 has several times the capability of HW3, making it easier to implement features."

These statements suggest a possible safety gap where Hardware 3 may not meet the necessary standards for unsupervised FSD.

### Upcoming Updates for HW3 Owners

Despite these hesitations, Musk committed to updating some Hardware 3 vehicles to Tesla’s newer autonomous computer, contingent upon certain conditions:
- **Free Update for FSD Purchasers**: Owners who purchased FSD with Hardware 3 will be eligible for an update, although not all HW3 vehicles will qualify.
- **Historical Context**: Previously, Tesla asserted that all vehicles produced after October 2016 had the requisite hardware for Full Self-Driving.

Musk emphasized, "If this turns out to be true, we'll ensure that those who bought FSD on HW3 are taken care of."

### Implications for Tesla’s Future

As Tesla navigates these challenges, the impact on consumer trust could be significant. If these updates fall short of expectations, it may prompt consumer protection efforts reminiscent of the Dieselgate scandal in the automotive industry.

### Financial Updates: Cybertruck and FSD Fallout

Switching gears, Tesla has achieved profitability with the Cybertruck, which marked a positive gross margin for the first time during Q3 2024. This success comes amid competitive pressures in the American truck market. It was noted that:
- **Sales Performance**: Tesla sold around 30,000 Cybertrucks, leveraging a hefty $20,000 tax on early adopters, generating substantial revenue.
- **Future Price Adjustments**: The price has been adjusted downwards, with the Cybertruck now starting at $79,990.

### Conclusion

The road ahead for Tesla remains complex as it grapples with these dual challenges of hardware updates and market competition. The promise of autonomy remains a core selling point for Tesla, but as the company's technology evolves, so too must its commitments to consumers. 

Stay tuned for more updates as this situation develops.
