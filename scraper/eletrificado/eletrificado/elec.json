According to the company’s press release, the W56 achieved an impressive 31 MPGe during FedEx’ real-world delivery route testing. That compares favorably to the national average fuel economy of 7 MPG for similar diesel delivery trucks, demonstrating significantly lower energy consumption per mile. Based on an average of 31,875 miles driven per vehicle per year, Workhorse says FedEx will be able to avoid an estimated 607 metric tons of harmful tailpipe emissions annually.\n\nWhat's the advantage of these vs. the generic electrical vans that the rest of the world uses for last mile delivery? Why do they need to be customized. That just sounds expensive. Also, these are pretty small numbers for a company this large. \n\nThey must have many thousands of vans. So 15 sounds all nice and cute. But why are they not committing more to spending less on fuel? Which sounds like it should be an easy decision.\n\n, and the company is still working to make good on that order following the completion of its Union City, Indiana manufacturing complex. Dubbed “Workhorse Ranch,” the company says its remodeled facility will be ultimately capable of building and painting 5,000 Workhorse vehicles per year on one shift.\n\nIn its 2023 financial statement, Workhorse claimed FedEx had seven Class 4 EV units in the delivery fleet, \n\n.\n\nWe’re well into Q3 2024, obviously, but I don’t want to be seen as unreasonably harsh on Workhorse. Heck, a few quarters here or there seems downright \n\n on a Tesla Semi timeline – I just think a bit of historical context is needed whenever we talk about startups like this. Head down to the comments and let me know if you agree.\n\n: \n\n, via \n\n.\n\n "},

Here’s what to expect.\n\nThe Ram 1500 REV is about ready for customer deliveries. Feuell (via \n\n) said that Ram’s first electric pickup will begin arriving at US dealerships in early 2025.\n\nEven before \n\n during the Super Bowl last February, the company boasted that the electric pickup would outperform the competition.\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares claimed in 2022 that the Ram 1500 REV would “outperform all competitors” with best-in-class range, towing, payload, and charging times. Last April, Ram unveiled further details during \n\n at the New York International Auto Show.\n\nRam said the 2025 1500 REV will have \n\n – 168 kWh or 229 kWh. The former has a 350-mile targeted range, while the latter targets up to a 500-mile driving range.\n\nThe company also claims its all-electric pickup can tow up to 14,000 lbs with a 2,700 lbs max payload. With 800V fast charging, the Ram 1500 REV can gain around 110 mi range in roughly 10 minutes.\n\nIn comparison, Ford’s 2024 Lightning, with an extended range (131 kWh) battery pack, offers up to 320 miles EPA-est range and up to 10,000 lbs towing. Rivian’s R1T gets up to 420 miles range with 11,000 lbs max towing.\n\nTesla’s Cybertruck, which is taking the US market by storm, has an estimated driving range of up to 340 miles and can tow up to 11,000 lbs.\n\nAccording to \n\n latest data, 5,175 Tesla Cybertrucks were \n\n in July, nearly topping all other EV pickups combined with 5,546 registrations.\n\nWill Ram’s first electric pickup find its place in the US market? We will find out early next year. Ram has yet to reveal pricing, but the electric pickup is expected to start at upwards of $60,000. The 2024 Ram 1500 (gas-powered) starts at $41,415.\n\nFollowing the REV 1500, the company will launch the \n\n, an extended-range (gas-powered) model.

The Ramcharger is essentially a hybrid pickup with a 3.6 liter V-6 engine.\n\nTechnically not wrong as it is a form of hybrid (plug-in series hybrid to be specific), but the RAMcharger will have a 92 kWh battery and and its powertrain is 100% electric. I don't believe they've released all-electric range yet, but it will (at least) be in the 100 to 200+ mile range based on the fully electric version battery sizes.\n\nIt would be far more appropriate to describe the RAMcharger as an EV with a built in generator that takes the form of 3.6 liter V-6 engine. It think this is the direction full size trucks should go for now. 200 kWh battery packs just aren't practical right now. You can make 2 RAMchargers with the batteries for one REV and both will run full-electric almost all the time. Until battery prices come way down, a gas engine is a better option for the rare occasion that the owner needs to tow something than adding an extra EVs worth of batteries to the truck is.\n\nAfter that, Ram is expected to launch a mid-size electric pickup. However, production was delayed at its Belvidere, IL factory until 2027.\n\nRam owner Stellantis announced an over \n\n last week to retool three Michigan plants for EV production. Stellantis confirmed its Sterling Heights Assembly Plant (SHAP) will be the first in the US to build an all-electric vehicle, the Ram 1500 REV.\n\nStellantis also invested nearly $100 million into its Warren Truck Assembly Plant to prepare for Jeep’s first global EV, the Wagoneer S.

Several are already rolling out, like the new EV3, but Kia aims to lower the bar further with a new entry-level EV, starting around $22,200 (€20,000). On the other end of its EV lineup, Kia is eyeing a new Stinger GT-like model.\n\nWe got our first glimpse into Kia’s electrifying future during its \n\n last October. Kia revealed several new low-cost concepts, including the EV3, EV4, and EV5.\n\nKia is already calling the EV3 a “game-changer” as it rolls out to new markets. After opening EV3 pre-orders in Korea starting at just $30,700 (KRW 42.08 million) in June, Kia’s compact electric SUV secured \n\n in 23 days.\n\nLast month, Kia opened \n\n. Starting at $42,300 (£32,995), Kia deemed it the “brand’s most adorable EV yet.”\n\nBased on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform with its fourth-gen batteries (81.3 kWh), the EV3 offers up to 372 miles (600 km) WLTP range. In Korea, it gets up to 311 miles (501 km) driving range.\n\nNext year, Kia will follow it up with the EV4 hitting the market. The EV4 is Kia’s take on an electric sedan. It’s expected to start at around $35,000 to $40,000.\n\nAlthough these prices are already below or on par with a comparable gas-powered model, Kia plans to lower the threshold with even cheaper EVs set to join the lineup.\n\nKia has already confirmed that it will launch an EV2 model, priced around $30,000, within the next three years. However, the brand is eyeing an even lower-priced model.\n\nCEO Ho-Sung Song told \n\n during an EV3 test drive that Kia wants to launch an entry-level EV priced around $22,200 (€20,000).\n\nKia trademarked the names EV1 through EV9, opening up the possibility for cheaper EVs following the EV3. Song said the entry-level EV was the brand’s “next, next target” as it looks to lower the threshold for driving electric.\n\nAccording to Song, an EV priced below €20,000 would not be likely until after 2030. As new battery and EV powertrain tech emerge, Kia plans to continue lowering the price tag.\n\nThe EV3 starts at around €35,000 ($39,000) in Europe, while Kia’s EV2 is expected to start below €30,000 ($33,400).\n\n“Our next target is an EV model starting from €30,000,” Song said. Yet Kia still believes “we need sub-€25,000 in our EV cars, and maybe we can leverage around €20,000,” Song explained. That “cannot happen in the next two years,” Kia’s CEO added.\n\nKia is also considering a brand-building electric car, like the Stinger GT, to top off the other end of the lineup.\n\n“What kind of model can help build the brand? This is what we are now studying,” Song said. While more incentives are needed, Song explained, “most OEMs are trying our best to reduce the cost of EVs” in the meantime.\n\nSong also confirmed that Kia is developing solid-state batteries that look “in every aspect quite better” than current EV battery tech. However, Kia’s CEO did not say when the company would put electric cars with solid-state batteries on the road.\n\n "},

The move comes during a period of growing financial losses for the company and follows accusations of potential subsidy fraud in its domestic market of Taiwan.\n\nThe \n\n described the announcement as a bombshell. Luke had built Gogoro largely from the ground up while maintaining major influence over the company’s designs and operations, from minute details to major strategy.\n\n“After much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to step down from my role as CEO and chairman of Gogoro,” Luke explained in the announcement. “This decision has not been easy, but I believe it is the right time for the company and I to transition leadership as we embark on the next phase of growth. My confidence in Gogoro’s bright future remains steadfast. I will always be Gogoro’s biggest advocate, and I look forward to seeing the company continue to grow and succeed from a new vantage point.”\n\nLuke nor the company provided a reason for the departure.\n\nGogoro’s board appointed Henry Chiang as the interim CEO. Chiang served as the general manager of Gogoro since 2022 and head of the company’s sharing operations GoShare team from 2018 to 2022.\n\nThe Board also appointed Tamon Tseng as the new director and Chairman of the Board to replace Luke.\n\nGogoro’s electric scooters and iconic green-on-black batteries have become famous around the world, demonstrating hundreds of thousands of battery swaps a day from a large user base. The system has been touted as the first practical battery-swapping initiative to demonstrate successful operation on a massive scale, counting hundreds of millions of battery swaps to date.\n\nHowever, during its period of rapid growth and international expansions over the last several years, the company has seen ballooning financial losses.\n\nReports also began swirling last week of subsidy fraud, with accusations that Gogoro received subsidies from the Taiwanese government intended for domestic manufacturers while failing to disclose that some of its components were actually produced in China.\n\nGogoro, which trades on the NASDAQ, \n\n after Luke resigned, explaining that the company had conducted an internal investigation into the accusations of subsidy fraud.\n\n“During such investigations, the Company has identified certain irregularities in supply chain which caused the Company to inadvertently incorporate certain imported components in some of its vehicles,” says the filing. “The Company has reported the irregularities in supply chain to the local authorities and is fully cooperating with the local authorities in their investigations, while also continuing with its internal investigations.”\n\nWell, this is not the news I was hoping to cover today. \n\nI’m a Gogoro rider myself (my Gogoro is my and my wife’s daily driver vehicle) and have long been a fan of the company’s technology. Gogoro’s spread around much of Asia and, more recently, into the Middle East and South America speaks to how well the technology works – something I’ve known from using it each day.\n\nBut running such a massive operation is not cheap, especially when investing in massive local factories for the scooters and the batteries. Gogoro’s own statement to the SEC describes its use of foreign-made components in some vehicles as “inadvertent,” and we haven’t yet heard from Luke on whether there was any wrongdoing. But as the leader of a company, especially one that proudly involves himself in nearly every aspect and regularly pores over the small details, the buck obviously has to stop with him.\n\nHopefully, Gogoro can move past this, as the company’s electric scooters and important battery-swapping technology have proven to be such a major weapon in the reduction of emissions in countries all over Asia that are heavily reliant on combustion engine motorcycles for transportation. Many Westerners have asked me when Gogoro would be expanding to Europe and North America, and so the international demand is obviously there. Now we just need to hope Gogoro is able to sort things out and continue on with its important mission of bringing affordable, high-tech electric vehicles and battery-swapping technology to areas of the world where it makes the biggest difference.\n\n "},

As new EVs hit the market, the lease deals are heating up. Here are all the EVs you can lease for under $300 a month this September.\n\nA record 330,463 electric vehicles were sold in the US in the second quarter. According to \n\n, EVs accounted for 8% of total new vehicle sales in Q2, up from 7.1% in the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe growth was driven by the influx of new models, massive discounts, and higher leasing rates. A big factor behind leasing is the ability to pass on the $7,500 federal tax credit to lessees.\n\nMost automakers are slapping the $7,500 on top of additional incentives like lease bonus cash, conquest, and loyalty offers.

With only $1,999 due at signing, Honda’s electric SUV can be leased for an effective rate of $325 a month.\n\nThe Prologue EX also has a range of up to 296 miles, compared to the Niro EV, which has an EPA-estimated 253-mile driving range. Despite the Prologue’s higher starting price ($47,400 vs  $39,600), Honda offers more incentives, including a loyalty (or conquest) bonus.\n\nVolkswagen’s ID.4 is available for $219 for 36 months. With $3,499 due at signing, the 2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Standard has an effective cost of $316 per month.\n\nAfter unveiling the \n\n, Hyundai’s IONIQ 5 is one of the best EVs to lease in September.\n\nThe 2024 Hyundai IONIQ 5 SEL RWD is listed at $209 for 33 months. With $3,999 due upfront, you can drive off in a new IONIQ 5 for $330 a month.\n\nHyundai’s electric fastback, the IONIQ 6, is listed at $299 for 33 months. The 2024 IONIQ 6 SEL RWD, with $3,999 due at signing, has an effective cost of $420 per month.\n\nIts third EV, the Kona Electric, is slightly more expensive at $362 for 24 months.

{"title": "There are now more electric cars than gas cars on Norway’s roads", "author": "Jameson Dow", "text": "Sometime this month, Norway will have more electric cars on its roads than petrol-only vehicles, according to an analysis of Norwegian government data.\n\nThe \n\n comes courtesy of Bilbransje24, a Norwegian auto industry publication. It used data from Norway’s Road Traffic Information Council (Opplysningsrådet for Veitrafikken, OFV).\n\nNorway releases detailed monthly information about auto sales in the country, which has been helpful for those of us tracking the EV market in the most EV-obsessed country in the world.  It \n\n with 94% EV new car market share in August.\n\nNorway has long been a standout, with the highest level of EV market share of any country and an aspiration to end sales of new gas cars by 2025, while other \n\n and \n\n focus on a relatively weak 2035 target.\n\nBut it even managed to \n\nmeet that 2025 aspiration early, with non-electrified vehicles only making up a single-digit percentage of sales in the country \n\n. Some countries even \n\n as sales continued to drop.\n\nAs is the case with most technologies, the last few percent is always a struggle, but we think getting down to single digits might as well be a win (for reference, California’s \n\n still allows up to 20% of vehicle sales to be PHEVs, which do have a combustion engine in them).\n\nAnd the combined effect of so many years of extremely high EV sales, and extremely low gas-car sales, means that we’ve seen the installed base of gas vehicles shrink as the installed base of EVs continues to rise. And now, finally, those lines have crossed.\n\nAs of the end of last month, there were 751,450 electric cars in service in Norway and 755,244 petrol-only cars, each making up about 26% of the cars on the roads.\n\nGiven that EVs are selling at a rate of about ~10,000 vehicles per month, and petrol-only cars are selling at a rate of about…. zero (okay, maybe a few hundred) per month, that means these lines will cross around the middle of this month. So… just about now.\n\nThis does leave out one powertrain type though, diesel, which was quite popular in Norway throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. Diesel’s installed-based crossed that of petrol-only vehicles in late 2014, and they have remained the most common vehicles on Norwegian roads since then. There are just over a million diesel vehicles in Norway (that number will drop below a million at the end of this month), so diesel-only still reigns supreme on Norwegian roads, ahead of EVs. \n\nBut EVs are growing, and growing more rapidly than diesel ever did. And both petrol-only – which EVs just advanced ahead of – and diesel-only vehicles are dropping in popularity. “Peak diesel” was reached in 2017, though today they make up 35% of Norway’s cars. Peak petrol-car sales were reached in Norway in 2005.\n\nEach of these numbers leave out hybrids, which make up a smaller amount, both plug-in and otherwise. There are around 208k plug-in hybrids and 156k non-plug-in hybrids on the roads in Norway now. The installed base of plug-in hybrids became larger than that of non-plug-in ones back in 2019.\n\nAnd the installed-base of diesel and petrol vehicles don’t get driven as often as newer, more efficient EVs do, so the \n\n have resulted in an outsized effect on motor fuel sales in the country. Last year, \n\n did an analysis of how \n\n.\n\nAs usual, Norway is showing the rest of the world how this should all work.\n\nAs the mix of vehicles on Norway's roads continues to shift towards EVs, petrol stations will close, and that will push the holdouts to convert.  Norway has one big advantage here by being the first mover: people who convert should still be able to get relatively good value for their used ICE cars, as they can be shipped and sold in other EU countries.  That also will help smooth the transition for Norway, but may be an obstacle for the slower countries to convert.\n\nMeanwhile, most countries aren’t even close to having\n\nnew EV sales eclipse new gas car sales, and Norway is already out here with more EVs \n\n than gas cars.\n\nFor all the complaints and protestations of impossibility, the Nordic countries have by and large left gas behind. All have high EV penetration, led by Norway, and there have not been any of the widespread problems that fossil fuel propaganda constantly tries to convince you that high EV use would lead to.\n\nMaybe instead of listening to \n\n who are \n\n to\n\n, we should just take a look at how one of the \n\n has \n\n, and take a few notes.\n\n "},

The new electric crossover SUV was developed with China’s leading EV maker, BYD.\n\nToyota introduced the \n\n at the 2024 Beijing Motor Show in April. The electric crossover was showcased next to the bZ3X, a larger SUV designed for families.\n\nThe bZ3X was built by \n\n, a joint venture established in 2020 to explore electric vehicle and battery development. Others, including FAW Toyota, were involved in the process.\n\nToyota said the bZ3C is designed around a “Reboot” concept that includes fun features to attract younger Gen Z buyers.\n\nIn comparison, the bZ3X SUV aims to provide a “Cozy Home” as a family-mover. Both models are specifically designed for the Chinese market.\n\nWe are getting a closer look at the smaller crossover after documents were published by China’s \n\n on Friday.\n\nThe documents show the pure electric powertrain with an LFP battery from \n\n Wuwei Fudi Battery Co. The 268 hp (200 kW) electric powertrain is also sourced from BYD.\n\nI feel like Toyota's branding / model naming of these cars borders on intentional self-sabotage. They look almost like strong wifi passwords. I was thinking about the bZ14QQ but then the bZ3.i0 really caught my eye\n\nToyota will offer optional 21″ or 18″ wheels, a black rear spoiler, and laser radar on the front windshield. \n\nAt 4,780 mm long, 1,866 mm wide, and 1,510 mm tall, Toyota’s new electric crossover is about the size of Tesla’s Model Y (4,750 mm long x 1,921 mm wide x 1,624 mm tall).\n\nIt will be Toyota’s third EV to launch in China, following the bZ4X and bZ3. Toyota is expected to launch the new bZ4C later this year. Production is scheduled to begin at FAW-Toyota’s plant in Tianjin by the end of 2024. Although not disclosed, \n\n expects the new EV will have around 310 mi (500 km) to 373 miles (600 km) CLTC range.\n\nWhat do you think of Toyota’s electric crossover?

Here’s what it means for its production growth.\n\nThe 4680 battery cell is a new format, 46mm x 80mm, enabled by a few new technologies that Tesla announced at Battery Day in 2020.\n\nIt’s the first time that Tesla is manufacturing its own battery cells – although other cell manufacturers have since announced plans to build batteries in this new format.\n\nAs with any new technology, the production ramp has been difficult. Four years later, Tesla has yet to reach its goal for the 4680 cell, but it did announce an important milestone this weekend.\n\nTesla says that it produced its 100th millionth 4680 cell:\n\nThe Tesla Optimus humanoid robot holding the cell has reportedly played a small, emphasis on “small”, role in manufacturing the cell.\n\nCumulative production is not a very useful metric to track battery production, but it is a new data point.\n\nTesla announced that \n\n.\n\nPrior to that, \n\n. However, the early production was at Tesla’s pilot plant in California rather than Gigafactory Texas. It’s unclear if these count into the total.\n\nBut we now know that Tesla produced 90 million battery cell in the last 14 months.\n\nThe bulk of that production is expected to have happened more recently as Tesla is ramping up production to support Cybertruck production.\n\nTesla’s 4680 cell is believed to have an energy capacity of roughly 100 Wh, which would mean that Tesla has produced about 9 GWh worth of 4680 cells over the last 14 months or enough for over 60 ,000 Tesla Cybertruck.\n\nAlthough, some of those cells were likely used for Model Y production before Tesla switch to Cybertruck production.\n\nA month ago, \n\n – an important step toward achieving its goals for the cell.\n\n100M cells would enough for around 75K cyber trucks with around 1344 cells each. So, that matches their production ramp-up since the beginning of the year and a few model Ys. And perhaps a few semis.\n\nInteresting to note that the market is heading for over production. Bloomberg NEF is tracking multiple twh of battery factory related investments for next year. So, that means prices might drop. Which is not necessarily beneficial for this particular cell as long as they are still trying to scale up production and reduce cost. Part of the promise of this cell was to use it as a structural component; which means you cannot easily swap it for something else.\n\nWhen this cell was originally announced, there was actually a battery shortage. And LFP is now pretty common. And soon some solid state battery production should ramp up; possibly to similar levels soonish. So, there is a bit more choice in the market.\n\nTesla appears to be making real progress in terms of ramping up production of 4680 cells.\n\nHowever, that’s just part of the puzzle. The cell is supposed to bring cost improvements, energy density improvements, and longevity improvements. Those remain to be seen.\n\nWe previously shared a report that stated CEO Elon Musk gave Tesla’s 4680 team by the end of the year to deliver on those improvements. The CEO himself noted that the need for Tesla to produce its own cell has been reduced as other automakers reduced their EV goals – freeing up battery production capacity from manufacturers.\n\nTesla aims to reach cost parity with those manufacturers with its own battery cell by the end of the year.\n\n "},

{"title": "A Tesla Semi has already traveled 250,000 miles: here’s what we learned about the electric truck", "author": "Fred Lambert", "text": "We learned a lot about Tesla Semi thanks to a new presentation from the head of the electric truck program at Tesla, including the fact that Tesla ran one of the trucks 250,000 miles (400,000 km) already.\n\nTesla Semi has already been “in production” for almost 2 years, but the production has been very limited and one could even argue that it was a “pilot” run until Tesla brings the vehicle to volume production at\n\n.\n\nThe automaker is believed to have built a fleet of about 100 Tesla Semi trucks and it is mostly using them internally and with its customer-partner PepsiCo.\n\nNow, Dan Priestley, the head of the Tesla Semi program, has given a presentation at the IAA conference in Germany today to give an update on how the program is going.\n\nA video of the presentation hasn’t surfaced yet, but people attending the event have released images of the slides and some of the highlights of the statistics revealed by Priestley:\n\nFor example, we learn that the Tesla Semi fleet has already traveled 7.5 million miles and that a single truck has traveled 250,000 miles (400,000 km) over the last 1.5 years.\n\nThanks to the resurgence of consumer electric vehicles, we already know that electric powertrains could deliver better performance in commercial trucks, but many still doubt that the batteries will have the energy capacity and longevity to make commercial electric trucking viable.\n\nThis data should help convince more people.\n\nWith \n\n with virtually the same capacity of a diesel truck, Tesla is making the argument that a Tesla Semi can replace a diesel class 8 truck one-for-one.\n\nPriestley also claimed that Tesla is seeing 95% uptime with the trucks, which is important as downtime means losing money for trucking companies.\n\nThe arguably most important information to come out of the presentation is that the current Tesla Semi fleet is proving an efficiency of 100 kWh to travel 100 km (62 miles):\n\nAt 1.6 kWh per mile, this is a little better than the 1.7 kWh per mile that Tesla previously predicted.\n\nThe engineer said that Tesla plans to deliver the electric trucks to more customers this year, but volume production is going to come with the new factory next year.\n\nThe goal is to reach an annualized production capacity of 50,000 trucks in 2026.\n\nThis is awesome. Again, Tesla Semi is the program I am most excited about at Tesla right now. Based on its history of delivering efficient electric vehicles in volume profitably, I think Tesla is the one to make commercial electric trucks happen at scale.\n\nThere are already many competitors out there, but none are currently talking about 50,000 units per year, which would make a real impact on the industry, by 2026.\n\nIt's not a question of if it is more efficient or not, it is. Electric vehicles are. But the real question is from an economic standpoint, does it make sense from a total trade off of payload? Diesel is expensive, but in terms of payload, it ain't that expensive.\n\nIf these numbers are accurate, I think it could actually work,\n\nNow, the bigger problem to solve is going to be the infrastructure as we are going to adapt truck stops to support megawatt charging at scale. It’s not an easy problem, but it is solvable and worth doing to decarbonize commercial transportation.\n\nIf we couple that charging to cheap renewable energy, we have a winning solution.\n\n "},

Even with a 100% tariff rate, BYD would have the cheapest EV in the US at under $25,000.\n\nTesla, which still holds a commanding lead (48% share in July) in the US EV market, has yet to break the $30,000 threshold.\n\nChinese automakers, like BYD, have an advantage with established supply chains, enabling lower prices.\n\nElectric vehicles accounted for over 50% of passenger vehicle sales in China in July. In the US, EVs \n\n of the light vehicle market during the same period, according to the latest \n\nfigures.\n\nChinese companies, including BYD and CATL, also dominate the global battery market. According to \n\n, CATL (35.9%) and BYD (16.5%) led global EV sales in the second quarter based on shipment.\n\nThrough the first eight months of 2024, CATL accounted for 37.6% of the global EV battery market, while BYD took second with 16.1%.\n\nBYD is not planning to launch passenger EVs in the US, at least not in the near term. However, McCabe’s comments should spark concern among some US rivals.\n\nAs BYD continues launching lower-priced EVs with more range and advanced features, several US automakers continue delaying significant projects.\n\nFord \n\n, opening the door for overseas rivals like Kia and Hyundai to take advantage. GM is also pushing back its battery factory in Indiana and could turn to CATL for LFP batteries in the US, like Ford and Tesla.\n\nFord is shifting its focus to smaller, more profitable EVs after seeing the success of Chinese automakers like BYD. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley called BYD’s Seagull “pretty damn good” as he warned rivals of BYD’s advantage.\n\nThe fact is tariffs will likely only lead to more EV delays, putting the US further behind as the global auto industry shifts to electric.\n\nInstead, investing in building a domestic supply chain, as it has with recent legislation, like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will incentivize US automakers. A stable US domestic supply chain would help reduce the price of EVs, lowering the threshold and promoting adoption.\n\nSource: \n\n "},

Bringing up the rear, while not necessarily a Green Deal, we did also notice \n\n hitting a 2024 low, which makes a welcome support alongside your electric yard tools. Plus, all the other hangover Green Deals that are still alive and well, like the latest \n\n, or the best price we’ve seen this year on the \n\n, and more.\n\nHead below for other New Green Deals we’ve found today and, of course, \n\nand \n\n. Also, check out the new \n\n.\n\nLectric is giving folks one of the best bundle deals we’ve seen on its \n\n that adds $720 in free gear to your purchase at \n\n. This massive package would normally cost you $3,019 in all, which is the biggest addition of add-on accessories that we’ve seen for this model. What makes this such a great deal is the inclusion of a free extra battery that ramps up its long-range traveling capabilities even further – plus, you’ll also be getting a rear cargo rack and fenders for both wheels. Learn more about this micromobility solution below or in our \n\n.\n\nLectric’s \n\n is the company’s premium commuter solution that was designed to bring high-quality parts like the Pinion auto-shifting electric gearbox and a carbon fiber-reinforced drive belt into a more budget-friendly price range. It’s been given a 750W rear hub motor that peaks at 1,310W, as well as a 48V 14Ah battery that can power the motor up to 60 miles on a single charge normally (extended to 100+ miles thanks to the extra battery). It tops out at speeds of 28 MPH when permitted by state laws and comes supported by five levels of PWR pedal assistance with 96 magnet cadence sensors, which is well over the typical 12 you see on a lot of standard e-bikes.\n\nIt’s been equipped with a 24A potted motor controller that better ramps up to its peak power output for inclines and bursts of speed when needed. There’s a thumb throttle for when you want to just cruise around with little effort (though keep in mind this does lower its travel range), 20-inch puncture-resistant city tires that have been designed to take hits and keep going, an integrated LED headlight and taillight, hydraulic mineral oil brakes, hidden cable routing, a kickstand, and a new color LCD display.\n\nYou can check out all the other \n\n – with models receiving up to $727 in free gear.\n\nWellbots is giving \n\n readers another exclusive chance at massive savings on the \n\n, \n\n Already seeing a steep fall from its normal $5,598 price tag (with Anker’s online storefront starting at a higher $6,498 list price), we’ve only tracked a handful of previous discounts on this bundle since hitting the market in January, with the biggest of them coming in at the tail-end of July from Wellbots and dropping $200 lower, while direct-from-Anker sales have only seen it fall as low as $4,199. You can score it here today with this exclusive offer at the second-best rate we’ve seen, and giving you nearly $2,000 in savings ($2,899 in savings off Anker’s storefront).\n\nWith \n\n, you’re getting a mobile backup solution that dishes out up to 6,000W of power output from its doubled 7,680Wh LiFePO4 battery capacity, courtesy of the bundled expansion battery. The unit itself sports plenty of ports to cover your needs for traveling, camping, and even total home support during blackouts – with eight ACs, three USB-Cs, two USB-As, one DC, and one car port. There are also connections to hook up and support your RV, an electric car, and your home’s circuit breaker. One thing to note about the latter support: you will need either a Home Backup Kit for sectional home support or you can utilize the Home Power Panel that keeps your entire household up and running (Both sold separately).\n\nThe F3800 comes with a variety of recharging options, with the main two being a 2.7-hour charge when plugged into a standard wall outlet or a quicker two-hour charge when connected to its maximum 2,400W solar input. The unit features a rollable design, with wheels along its bottom for extra convenience, along with an LCD display that lets you monitor and adjust its settings – plus, there are remote smart controls that you can access via the companion app too.\n\nThrough its \n\n, Best Buy is offering a great entry-level e-bike option with some alternative style in the form of the \n\n. Normally priced at $1,000 most days, with a higher $1,198 MSRP direct from Hyper, we’ve seen very few discounts on this particular model, often coming from Hyper themselves and often at much higher rates orbiting $1,000. Today, you’re looking at the chance to score a 40% markdown, saving you $400 off its Best Buy rate (and $598 off its full MSRP) while landing it at the lowest price we can find.\n\nHyper’s \n\n delivers a fun mash-up between e-mobility solutions and a 26-inch BMX platform, giving folks a colorfully stylish change-up from many models on the market that also makes a great first-time ride for teens and adults alike. It has been given a 250W rear-hub motor alongside an integrated flush-mount 36V 10.4Ah battery and three levels of pedal assistance. It tops out at 20 MPH and can carry the rider up to 20 miles on a single four-hour charge. It’s been equipped with 26-inch multi-surface fat tires for enhanced traction for wherever you’re riding – streets, off-road trails, bike parks, etc. It also sports front and rear disc brakes, a premium BMX padded seat, and a simple handlebar-mounted controller to switch between its settings.\n\nAmazon is bringing down the costs on the \n\n, with the model more regularly fetching $420. Husqvarna is one of the higher-end tool brands that see less frequent discounts than others, with this model, in particular, seeing a few price cuts over 2024, but still keeping above $335. Today though, we’re seeing a bigger markdown than ever before as $127 is being taken off its tag, landing it at a new all-time low that gives fans of the brand a great chance to upgrade at only 70% the usual cost.\n\nThis \n\n is one of several versatile models that falls within Husqvarna’s Combi Switch family, with the edger attachment able to switch out with over 14 others in a matter of moments, giving folks a more manageable system to perform their garden and lawncare duties without needing an individual tool for each job. The edger attachment sports an 8-inch steel cutting blade that provides a 2.5-inch cutting depth, along with a 6-inch adjustable wheel for smooth operations to keep your lines on a straight and narrow path. There’s no cords here to worry about either, with the Combi Switch motor ready to also take any other Husqvarna batteries you’ve invested in for longer runtimes too. \n\nAmazon is offering the \n\n. More recently fetching $80 at full price after falling from its $110 MSRP at the tail-end of last year, we’ve seeing this model drop as low as $35 direct from AeroGarden, and as low as $40 from Amazon, with the prices keeping around $80 since May. Today, costs are dropping a bit lower to usher in fall, with a 25% markdown that lands it among its lowest Amazon rates and gives you a great option to enjoy fresh veggies and herbs during the colder months ahead.\n\nOn the smaller and more compact end of AeroGarden’s lineup of hydroponic indoor gardens, \n\n utilizes a grow deck and water bowl to cultivate your favorite vegetables, herbs, or flowers so you can do away with messy soil for a tidier experience. You can grow up to three different plants at once to a size of up to 10 inches tall here, with a full-spectrum 10W LED grow light that expediates growth at up to five times faster a rate than if you were to use soil. It also comes with a Gourmet Herb Seed Pod kit to get you started, with all you need to grow and enjoy fresh Genovese Basil, Curly Parsley, and Dill.\n\nYou can go even bigger with your plant cultivation with \n\n which is currently going for \n\n. In this model, you can grow a total of six plants up to 12 inches tall – coming with its only six-pod seed kit for Genovese Basil, Curly Parsley, Dill, Thyme, Thai Basil, and Mint. It also includes a vacation mode that helps you keep your plants growing when you’re away from the house for longer periods. There’s also a special promotion on the \n\n that give you \n\n one unit when buying two or more, which you can \n\n.\n\nCourtesy of its \n\n, Best Buy is offering the popular \n\n. You’ll normally find this handy yard cart at $230 most days, with discounts only dropping every few months. We’ve seen costs this year brought down to $170 at the lowest during one of Best Buy’s previous one-day sales back in July, with the others keeping between $172 and $179 (the latter being its recent Prime Day rate). Today is bringing us the best price we’ve seen so far in 2024 at a $70 markdown – which is also \n\n too.\n\nAdding \n\n to your tool shed will make enormous jobs around your yard and/or garden far more manageable than your average wheelbarrow, with it sporting multi-use functionality and a 300-pound payload. It’s been designed to provide eight different configurations, able to transform in a few moments between a lightweight wheelbarrow to a yard cart, or even a bag holder, dolly – which extends further out too for larger transport jobs – as well as a cylinder carrier, rock/plant mover, or a trailer tote. If you’ve got some large-scale plans for your gardens/yard, you’re going to want a larger scale of support so you can properly show off your green thumb and/or landscaping prowess.\n\nThe savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear.\n\n "},

You can choose your favorite from Rock, Country, Pop, R&B, Latin, K&J Pop, or family-friendly songs to sing along to.\n\nThe songs are available in 38 languages, including 10 in local characters like Thai, Hebrew, and Greek.\n\nFord Lightning owners can access the Karaoke feature while parked or charging. Once they select a song, the lyrics are displayed on the infotainment screen so they can sing along with friends and family.\n\nFord’s engineers worked with Stingray to develop a “unique drivetime experience” for passengers. To use it, you can tap the new Stingray Karaoke app.\n\nOnce the vehicle detects that the passenger is buckled, a QR code will appear on the screen. You can use your smartphone to scan the code, which will take you to a webpage where you will find the catalog of songs without having to log in to an app.\n\nThe \n\n will be available to all Ford Lightning owners starting with the 2024 model year. However, to be eligible for the update, you must have the SYNC 4A infotainment system.\n\nFord follows several automakers like \n\n and Tesla, which also have in-car Karaoke and other fun features. Although it may seem like a minor update, it’s a fun way to pass time while charging or parked.\n\nThe new feature also shows Ford’s commitment to using software for a better driving experience.\n\nWhat new features will Ford EV drivers gain next? We will likely find out shortly as Ford doubles down on software-defined vehicles.\n\n "},
{"title": "Tesla is pulling heavy financing weaponry in end-of-quarter push", "author": "Fred Lambert", "text": "Tesla has pulled the heavy weaponry when it comes to financing to boost sales during its regular end-of-quarter push.\n\nTesla has regularly introduced price cuts and incentives at the end of every quarter in order to boost sales and lower inventory.\n\nIt helps quarterly financial results look better as Tesla has already spent the money to build those vehicles and if they are not delivered by the end of the quarter, they end up in its “inventory” without generating any revenue.\n\nRecently, Tesla introduced, or reintroduced, incentives across its entire EV lineup except for the Cybertruck. \n\nFor example, \n\n, which basically result in a $1,000 discount on new cars.\n\nLately, Tesla has been subsidizing financing on its vehicles as a incentive.\n\nNow, the automaker has introduced zero down payment on Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, which can be combined with much lower APR:\n\nIf you put an ‘excellent’ credit rating in Tesla’s online configurator, you get a 5.59% interest rate, but if you choose the new “promotion” credit rating, Tesla is offering 0$ down payment and APR at 2.49%.\n\nWith a small down payment, you can get the rate down to 1.99%.\n\nThe promotion is running until September 30, which coincides with the end of the quarter.\n\nThis might be Tesla’s biggest promotion of the year. Compared to current interest rates, 2% is basically free money and the fact that nothing is due at delivery should attract a lot of people.\n\nI would expect that it will help Tesla clear its US inventory this quarter.\n\nBasically this is another \n\n discount, but done in a way that does not \n\n show up in the profit margins or operating margins this quarter due to the way Tesla does its financial accounting. Basically this is just creating losses for the next 2 years just to pad the numbers for this quarter.\n\nHowever, as we have previously reported, \n\n.\n\nTherefore, it is still unclear if Tesla can grow sales this quarter. The automaker delivered 444,000 vehicles last quarter and 435,000 vehicles in Q3 2023.\n\nTesla is currently tracking to have its first year with a reduction in EV deliveries in a decade.\n\nInvestors will also be tracking profit margins as this new referral program and the subsidizing of financing should negatively impact margins. \n\n "},
{"title": "Maersk, PepsiCo, others to pilot a heavy-duty EV charging corridor between LA and El Paso", "author": "Michelle Lewis", "text": "Some of the world’s largest shippers and carriers will pilot heavy-duty EV charging along the “first-ever US over-the-road electrified corridor.”\n\nGlobal nonprofit \n\n today announced the launch of the shipper-carrier coalition, which includes AIT Worldwide Logistics, DB Schenker, Maersk, Microsoft, and PepsiCo. \n\nThe coalition will test long-haul heavy-duty BEV operations along the I-10 corridor between Los Angeles and El Paso, Texas. \n\n will provide charging infrastructure, including software, operations, and maintenance support, at six of its owned charging hubs along the I-10 corridor. \n\nNeha Palmer, CEO and cofounder of Terawatt, said, “As we continue to build out the I-10 electric corridor and utilize the recent $63.8M in grant funding alongside [New Mexico Department of Transportation] to develop reliable charging infrastructure solutions, we have a historic opportunity to work with global leaders who share our vision and investment into the sustainable future of mobility.”\n\nThe point of the pilot is, of course, to learn by putting the charging infrastructure in place and deploying heavy-duty EVs in a real-life situation. The bigger-picture aim is to share learnings with other shippers and carriers so that they, in turn, also transition to electrification at scale. The shipper-carrier coalition also wants to encourage technology providers to accelerate the development of turn-key solutions for electric transport.\n\nThe launch of this coalition aligns with the federal government’s National Zero-Emission Freight Corridor Strategy, which lays out a framework for electric truck adoption and charging infrastructure deployment.\n\nChristoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, said, “Through this coalition, we seek to jointly accelerate the uptake of long-haul EV heavy-duty trucks. Together with Terawatt and other coalition partners, we look forward to accelerating freight decarbonization and proving that the electric truck corridor can promptly become operational at low volumes and rapidly scale up afterward.”\n\n \n\n "},
